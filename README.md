# No Show Appointment
## Carolyn Cherono


## Prosper Loan Data

I chose the No-show appointments dataset for my data investigation project which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.


## Summary of Findings

From the bar chart we can see that patients who attend are more than those who do not attend and therefore there is a high chance that patients might attend the appointment.
Patients below ten years are among those who highly attend the appointment, it could be because they are being taken by their parents/guardians.
Patients around 50 years also are among those who highly attend the appointment, it could be because old age is approaching and they are becoming to take their health seriously.
Past 60 years their is a decrease in the number of patients who attend the appointment. It could be that some i.e those above 90 years doesn't have someone to take them because they are unable to walk.
Patients in some neighbourhoods attend the appointments than others, reason could be that it is easier to access healthcare facilities than in those neighborhoods where patient's attendance is low.
